# 1. Introduction

Welcome! This is the documentation for the **Lexicon PCM81 Editor**. This program allows you to change settings on your PCM81 effects unit from your computer, which is much easier than using the small screen on the device itself.

## What is this project?

This project is a computer program that "talks" to your PCM81 over MIDI cables. You can see all the settings on your computer screen and change them with your mouse and keyboard.

## What is "Electron"?

You might see the word **Electron** mentioned a lot. Electron is a tool that lets programmers build desktop apps (like this one) using the same technologies used to build websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Think of it as a special web browser that only runs this one specific "website" (our editor program) and lets it do things a normal website can't do, like talk to your MIDI cables.

## Key Terms for Beginners

- **Terminal / Command Prompt**: A text-based way to tell your computer what to do. You will type commands here to start the program.
- **Node.js**: A helper program that runs the JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: A tool that comes with Node.js to help install other tools we need.
